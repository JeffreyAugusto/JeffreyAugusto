### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**JeffreyAugusto/JeffreyAugusto** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the last (hopefully) CSS framework I'll ever need.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to be a more helpful colleague
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with like-minded, passionate people
